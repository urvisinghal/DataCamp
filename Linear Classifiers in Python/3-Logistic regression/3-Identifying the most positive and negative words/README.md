Identifying the most positive and negative words

In this exercise we'll try to interpret the coefficients of a logistic regression fit on the movie review sentiment dataset. The model object is already instantiated and fit for you in the variable lr.

In addition, the words corresponding to the different features are loaded into the variable vocab. For example, since vocab[100] is "think", that means feature 100 corresponds to the number of times the word "think" appeared in that movie review.
